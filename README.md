# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
Step1 : import numpy as np
Step 2: We have created a matrix using array and we will find inverse of this.
Step 3: We can find the inverse of the martix by using np.linalg.inv and passing the matrix.
Step 4: Finally, print the value of the inverse of the matrix.

## Program:
```
#Program to find the inverse of a matrix.
#Developed by:SUROTHAAMAN R
#RegisterNumber:23008504
import numpy as np
a=np.array([[1,0,3],[-1,2,-2],[2,3,-1]])
inverse=np.linalg.inv(a)
print(inverse)
```
## Output:

## Result:
Thus the inverse of given matrix is successfully solved using python program
